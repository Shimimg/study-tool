## Usage

Upload any PDF(s) with text in it. Feel free to use the sample document which consists of an AI generated summary of WW1.

Talk to the AI, ask for it to make you some notes, or ask it some questions about the document.

Click the **Generate** button for flash cards.

### Please note: The conversations and flash card creation will take moderate time to process as I am using a free model from Hugging Face
